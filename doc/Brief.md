# **Semester Project 2 brief**

## **Goal**

To take the skills learned over the past three semesters and create an auction website.

## **Brief**

An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have
put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items
and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make
bids on listings.

## **Requirements**

> All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for
> the API.
