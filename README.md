## Description

This project aimed to build a front-end auction website, leveraging skills acquired over three semesters. The goal was
to create a platform where users could list items for auction and bid on others' listings. New users would start with
1000 credits, earned from selling items and spent on purchasing them. Unregistered users could browse listings, but only
registered users could bid.

## Goal

To take the skills learned over the past three semesters and create an auction website.

## Requirements

* **API:** Front-end application for an existing API (Auction EndPoints in Noroff API documentation).

The client has specified the following requirements in the form of User Stories:

* **User Stories:**
* A user with a `stud.noroff.no` email may register
* Registered users can log in, log out, update avatars, and view credit totals.
* Registered users can create listings (title, deadline, media gallery, description) and place bids.
* Registered users can view bids on their listings.
* Unregistered users can search listings.

* **Technical Restrictions:**
* Use approved CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, MUI).
* Host on approved static hosts (GitHub Pages, Netlify).
* Use approved design (Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch) and planning applications (Trello, GitHub Projects).

* **Required Links:**
* Gantt chart for project timing.
* Design prototype (Figma).
* Style guide.
* Kanban project board.
* Repository link.
* Hosted application demo link (Not available due to incomplete code).
